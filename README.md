This code will classify breast cancer pictures as benign or malignant using a convolutional neural network. The pictures are loaded using the ImageDataGenerator class from Keras, which allows you to read images from a directory and perform data augmentation. The model is a simple convolutional neural network with four convolutional layers and max pooling layers, followed by two dense layers. The model is
